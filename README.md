# Pokemon_Battle_Game
Select three pokemon and battle them against a CPU in this pokemon mini-game!

>This is a fun project for anyone who would like to implement vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a small, but impressive game that runs in the browser.
## Usage
- Once the page has loaded, click on the button labeled "*select three pokemon*" and choose your selection of three pokemon.
- When the user clicks the "*done*" button in the pokemon selection modal, the turn based fight begins.
- The user gets a turn to use a move and then the computer.
- When a pokemon faints, it is replaced by the next pokemon in your or the computer's party.
- If all of the computer's party of pokemon are eleminated, the user wins.
- If all of the user's party of pokemon are eleminated, the computer wins and it's game over.
### Order of Creation
This is the order of operations in which I created this application.
- Created and organized files
- Provided a JS class constructor for pokemon and began building out pokemon classes
- Used CSS, HTML, and images to construct the battlefield
- Created a user object and cpu object that would both hold applicable properties
- Added a modal for pokemon selection
- Wrote JS script to handle user's pokemon selections, and randomize computer's selections
- Added healthbar, pokemon name display, and health system
- Wrote the turn-based battle logic
- Designed win/loss scenarios
- Searched for and fixed bugs
- Touched up on CSS styling for MVP
### Additions For Later
- Implement type damage buffs
- Allow user to switch out between his or her pokemon
